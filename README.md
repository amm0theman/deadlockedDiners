#diningPhilosophersNoDeadlock - my log4j files are external so won't be included in the git. Right click the project -> build path -> configure build path and then add external jars log4j-api-2.x.jar and log4j-core-2.x.jar to the build path. These are jars from the log4j 2 binaries of apache's website
